Changes made to make the code more semantic

1) Changed "div class = header" to just "header", and then changed the style.css where header is no longer a class but just a tag
2) Changed div footer in the same way as above
3) Replacted div tag inside header with "nav" and changed css to reflect that

How I made the code more semantic: 

1) changed "div class = header" to just header, and then changed the style.css where header is no longer a class but just a tag

2) changed div footer in the same way

3) added nav tag inside header, deleted div - also changed css
