Changes made to make the code more semantic

1) Changed "div class = header" to just "header", and then changed the style.css where header is no longer a class but just a tag
2) Changed div footer in the same way as above
3) Replacted div tag inside header with "nav" and changed css to reflect that

How I made the code more semantic: 

1) changed "div class = header" to just header, and then changed the style.css where header is no longer a class but just a tag

2) changed div footer in the same way

3) added nav tag inside header, deleted div - also changed css

4) consolidated classes in main section and side section

5) added comments to html and css

6) replaced the side section class div with an aside class 

7) replaced divs with sections

8) added alts to images
